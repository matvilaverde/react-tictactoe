# Hello, React, It's been a while!

Following official tutorial from React, I decided to return to React studies. This project is a Tic Tac Toe game, based on [Intro to React](https://reactjs.org/tutorial/tutorial.html), as I remember the language and use a different SO (Windows) to code a bit off work.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## How to Run

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.
